Machine Learning Lab 2 – Regression on Multiclass Clothing Sales Dataset 

The dataset used in this project is the Multiclass Clothing Sales Dataset, which contains 100,000 records and 20 features related to clothing store sales. It includes information about products, pricing, customer characteristics, and sales outcomes, such as product category, brand, season, selling price, discount percentage, customer age, purchase frequency, and quantity sold.

The machine learning problem addressed in this project is a regression task. The goal is to predict the number of items sold based on product-related, pricing-related, and customer-related features. By learning patterns from historical sales data, the model aims to estimate sales quantities and provide insights into demand behavior.
